# App Demo: Cyanogenmod + Three JS & CSS Animation

A simple experiment in three.js modeling and animation combined with css animation, and sprite based animation. I choose cyanogenmod as the theme that I worked against.

A working demo is available at [codepen](http://codepen.io/jeremygooch/pen/XXpzMj)


## Usage

Due to the way that [threejs](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) is setup, you will need to run a local web server to run this experiment locally.
